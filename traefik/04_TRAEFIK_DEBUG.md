## Errors

### Error respond from docker swarm
- If you get an error like this:  **"this node is not a swarm manager. Use "docker swarm init" or "docker swarm join" to connect this node to swarm and try again"** then you need to run the following command: docker swarm init

### Certificate not showing in letsencrypt folder

This is typically a problem with how the file is mounted into the Traefik container. Start Traefik and then go into
the Traefik container docker exec -it sh

Then navigate to where the acme file should be mounted. If you donâ€™t see then somehow your local path is not allowing
the file to get mounted. So try moving acme to the same directory as the compose file and try again.

### scale is deprecated

Since version 3.2.0, the scale option is deprecated.
Instead of using scale use replicas in the docker-compose file. See the following link for more information: https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/compose-file-v2/#scale
